Hi there! Your coding challenge description is below. You are free to complete this challenge at your own pace, but we recommend spending an hour and half and no more than two hours in total on this challenge.

Please start by clicking "Fork" at the top right. You will be asked to log in. You are free to click anonymous if you don't want to log in or create a profile. Regardless, please make sure to change the title of the CodePen at the top left with "yourname - Coding Challenge". 

Once complete, email me at jason@affinity.co with your CodePen link. We'll review your solution and be in touch within a few days. There is no need to submit anything--just make sure to hit "save" in Codepen so we can see your progress.

A few guidelines:
* Use any frameworks or libraries you like! We're including boilerplate code for Angular and React; feel free to use one of those, or any other framework, or plain HTML and JavaScript.
* Feel free to edit the Codepen's settings (using the Settings button in the top nav bar), which will allow you to add external CSS and JS, use different preprocessors for HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and more. By default, we include React, Angular, jQuery, and Underscore.
* Feel free to look up documentation and use Google to your heart's content (but all code you write must be your own, unless you document it otherwise).

To evaluate solutions, we'll focus on correctness of your functionality and on whether your coding style is clean; don't worry too much about the appearance of the UI.

----------------------------------------------------------
Your challenge: using HTML and JavaScript (and a bit of CSS), build a 1-player game of Concentration! See an example online game at http://www.play.vg/games/52-Concentration.html.

Here are the rules of concentration:
- 4 pairs of cards (8 cards total) are placed faced down. The faces of the cards are the images listed at the top of the JS file. (There are more images than you need.)
- The player selects two cards by clicking on them. When the player clicks on a face-down card, it flips over, revealing the front.
- Once two cards are selected, then after a 1-second delay:
  * If the cards match, the cards are removed from the board.
  * If the cards don't match, the cards are flipped back over.
- Once all cards are removed from the board, the player wins.

Your game should keep track of how many total pairs the user flipped over (so a perfect score would be 4). This score should be displayed at the completion of the game.

Assume no server-side component; keep track of all state in JavaScript.

CODEPEN DEBUGGING TIPS:
* JavaScript syntax errors will show up in the JavaScript editor itself (look for a red error button in the bottom right corner)
* The Codepen console will show you the output of "console.log" statements, but it won't show you JavaScript errors; to see JavaScript errors, you'll need to look at your browser's native JavaScript console.
